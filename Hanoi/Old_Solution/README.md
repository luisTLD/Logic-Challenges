# Tower of Hanoi - Old Solution

This folder contains my initial solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem

## Description

This is my first implementation of the Tower of Hanoi game, written in C++. It uses a stack-based approach to manage the disks and solve the puzzle

## Features

- Basic functionality to move disks between towers
- Command-line interface to interact with the game
- Simple error handling for invalid moves

## Notes

- This code represents my early attempt at solving the problem and has since been improved in subsequent versions
- The implementation is straightforward but lacks some optimizations and refinements present in the newer solution

Feel free to explore this version as a reference to how my approach has evolved
