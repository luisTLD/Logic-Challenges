# Old Boolean Algebra Solver

This directory contains an older solution for solving boolean algebra expressions. 

## Description

- **Functionality:** Handles boolean algebra expressions with AND (`and`), OR (`or`), and NOT (`not`) gates.
- **Notes:** This solution works but is considered suboptimal and less efficient compared to newer implementations.
- **Purpose:** Kept here for reference to demonstrate improvements over time.

Feel free to review this code as a historical reference to see how the solution has evolved.
